## What does a BIE do at Amazon?
- Our business intelligence engineers (BIEs) build out a variety of analytics. As a BIE, you’ll define key performance indicators (KPIs), automate data pipelines, and create reports, dashboards, and visualizations.  
- Our BIEs understand statistics, data warehousing, and Extract, Transform, and Load, (ETL), and they are proficient in SQL.  
- Our BIEs are able to work with ambiguous data, using advanced SQL and scripting to come up with answers that may not be immediately obvious.  
- Our BIEs are able to translate between business needs and data, and are able to create actionable insights for their stakeholders.

## Technical phone screening
Depending on the role, there will be one to two technical phone screenings. A technical phone screening lasts 60 minutes and is with a senior leader on our team. The interviewer will ask you behavioral/situational and technical questions.

### SQL
- You need to demonstrate a solid foundation in SQL. Always seek clarification and verify assumptions about the questions, even if you think they’re clear.  
- Be prepared to write SQL queries and think about edge cases. You’ll need to understand different types of joins and how condition filters affect the joins.   
- Be familiar with ways of simplifying a complex query and optimizing performance.  

**Sample questions:**  
- Give me a query that shows how many units I received per week, for the past year.
- Give me a query that shows how long it takes these units to arrive.
- Give me a list of item IDs that we received in the past two months, from more than one vendor, where the cost was different.

### Technical
- Practice ETL processes and data warehousing concepts.
- Hone your skills in data visualization tools.
- Brush up on statistics and coding skills.
- Learn diverse database management systems.
- Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms.
- Understand data security and compliance.

### Leadership Principles
- Familiarize yourself with Amazon’s Leadership Principles for behavioral questions. There’s no need to memorize them.
- Prepare a few specific examples related to recent projects, team interactions, and product deliveries (avoid confidential information).
- Emphasize the importance of data and analytics in supporting your decisions, as Amazon is data-driven.
- Highlight how your decisions or projects impacted customers and stakeholders, demonstrating customer obsession.

## Interview loop
- Your loop will include five 55-minute interviews where you’ll meet with members of our business intelligence community.  
- You’ll have the chance to discuss your experiences and expertise in several areas that help us determine success at Amazon.  
- These areas include both technical competencies and non-technical competencies that are based off of our Leadership Principles, which different interviewers will be assigned to evaluate.

### SQL and Basic scripting
- Be prepared to write SQL queries and think about edge cases. You’ll need to understand different types of joins and how condition filters affect the joins.
- There may also be more conceptual conversations around troubleshooting/tuning, composite keys, and temp tables.
- Familiarize yourself with some ETL strategies, SQL optimization techniques, and data modeling for dashboard performance.
- Write a list of requirements in your notes and keep asking questions, as the initial problem statement may be vague. Requirements should be the first thing you write.
- Interact with your interviewer. Ask necessary questions to complete the exercise.
- Know how your solution solves the problem. If you suggest technology to help solve, understand how that technology works.
- Think out loud as you work through the problem. This allows the interviewer to better follow and understand your thought process.
- Review your code and clean up any mistakes. Point out ways in which you can optimize the query for performance.
- Demonstrate your understanding of fundamental data warehousing concepts, such as star/snowflake, dimensions, facts, aggregates, fact-less, and hierarchies.

### Analytical problem solving
- Demonstrate your comfort with statistics concept and scripting.
- We want to ensure you understand basic statistics and can apply statistical methods to business problems.
- We may walk you through an analytical problem.
- You may be asked a basic coding/scripting question. We’re open to any software languages, but be prepared to talk through any technologies listed on your resume.

- Be prepared to build out analytics and visualizations for stakeholders, such as dashboards (Quicksight, Tableau, etc.), reports (Excel, etc.), and define KPIs that will result in measurable success.
- We don’t have a preference for specific visualization tools; we’re more interested in your process and approach.
- Speak through your thought process—this is very important!

**Expectations:**
- Demonstrate your ability to build highly leveraged reports ensuring optimal performance.
- Demonstrate your ability to perform deep dives on data on emerging business questions.
- Demonstrate your ability to identify and define proper metrics with the given datasets.

### Business acumen/requirements gathering
BIEs need to understand business requirements and how to translate them into meaningful data.

- Demonstrate how you would effectively work with a project manager or work on a specific business problem. We want to ensure you can smoothly work with the business to solve a problem.
- Show how you know what decisions are being made from the BI artifacts that you produce.
- Share examples of when you worked with a business to gather requirements, and when you created analysis and reporting that met customer use cases.
- Show how you problem solve by using data analysis or statistical methods.
- Demonstrate how you translate ambiguous problems into requirements and pull insights from analyzing data sets.

## Behavioral interview
- A significant portion of the conversation will focus on how you’ve demonstrated our Leadership Principles in your past jobs. This is because past behavior is an indicator of future success.   
- We won’t ask brain teasers. Instead, we’ll focus on the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of your experiences, as well as the ‘why’ of your decisions. 
- Each interviewer will typically ask two or three behavioral-based questions about successes or challenges and how you handled them using our Leadership Principles.

**Best practices:**
- Prepare to go deep into the details about your previous work.
- Use the STAR model to structure your responses, making it clear what actions you took in each situation.
- Focus on what you owned and worked on rather than what your team did. ‘I’ is better than ‘we.’

- Demonstrate transparency. Discuss how you’ve openly communicated and addressed issues honestly.
- Show how you’ve honored commitments and followed through on tasks until they were completed.
- Use examples where you sought input and included your team in decision-making.
- Don’t finger-point or blame-shift when discussing challenges. Focus on how you found a solution.
- Demonstrate how you built positive relationships with your team and made an effort to produce high-quality work.
- Provide examples when you sought feedback and learned from your mistakes.
- Show how you took ownership of business problems and worked to find solutions that improved performance.
- Include examples of when you learned new skills or technologies that were outside of your comfort zone.
- Discuss ways you improved processes and collaborated with other teams to achieve better results.
- Give examples of how you’ve followed through on projects and gathered metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of your solutions.
