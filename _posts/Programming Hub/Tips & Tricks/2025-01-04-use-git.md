## Git Basics   
You need to know some basic terminal commands to navigate the file system and interact with Git repositories.  
> Go to [Use Terminal](https://khoapham1002.github.io/mindpalace/posts/use-terminal/).


### Initialize and check status   
```bash
# Start a new Git repository in your current folder
git init

# Check current status: staged/unstaged files, untracked files, etc.
git status

# See your current branch (usually "main" after setup)
git branch

# See if this repo is connected to any remote (e.g., GitHub)
git remote -v
```


### Link and update remote repository   
```bash
# Link your local repo to a GitHub repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# Optional: Rename the current branch to "main" (standard name)
git branch -M main

# Push code for the first time and set the "origin/main" as default upstream
git push -u origin main
```

```bash
# Check the current linked remote repository
git remote -v

# Change the remote URL if the repo name or account changes
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/new-repo.git

# Pull latest changes from GitHub before pushing your own
git pull origin main

# Push your changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```


### Stage, commit and push (sync) changes
Repeat these 3 steps every time you make changes locally that you want to save to GitHub.

```bash
# Add all current changes to staging (ready to be committed)
git add .

# Save a snapshot of changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push commits to GitHub
git push origin main
```


### Tags
Tags are like bookmarks in your code history. Great for version releases.

```bash
# Create an annotated tag (useful for versioning)
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 - Initial stable release"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0

# Check out a specific tag (detached HEAD state)
git checkout v1.0
```

```bash
# Delete a tag locally if you made a mistake
git tag -d v1.0

# Delete the same tag from GitHub
git push origin --delete v1.0

# Recreate and push the updated tag again
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Updated version v1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```


### Branches
Use branches to work on new features or fixes without affecting your main code until it’s ready.

```bash
# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add: new feature"

# Push the new branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into main
git merge feature/my-new-feature

# Push the updated main branch
git push origin main

# Delete the local branch (cleanup)
git branch -d feature/my-new-feature
```

```bash
# Delete a branch from GitHub
git push origin --delete feature/my-new-feature

# Remove references to deleted remote branches (clean up)
git fetch --prune

# View all branches on the remote
git branch -r
```


### git stash – Save Changes Temporarily Without Committing
Use this when you’re in the middle of something but need to quickly switch branches or pull changes without committing messy code.

```bash
# Save your uncommitted changes (stash them away)
git stash

# See a list of stashed changes
git stash list

# Reapply the most recent stash and remove it from the list
git stash pop

# Reapply without deleting the stash (good for testing)
git stash apply

# Delete all stashes
git stash clear
```


### git diff – See What’s Changed
Use `git diff` to see changes between commits, branches, or your working directory.

```bash
# See changes in your working directory compared to the last commit
git diff

# See changes between the last commit and the staging area
git diff --cached

# See changes between two commits
git diff <commit1> <commit2>

# See changes between your current branch and another branch
git diff main..feature/my-new-feature
git diff branch-a..branch-b

# See changes in a specific file
git diff path/to/file
```


### git log – View Commit History
Use this to review what was changed, by whom, and when.

```bash
# See full commit history (most recent at top)
git log
git log --oneline

# View detailed commit history with branches
git log --oneline --graph --all

# View changes made in a specific commit
git show <commit-hash>

# View changes made to a specific file
git log -- path/to/file

# View who changed specific lines in a file
git blame path/to/file
```


### Undoing Changes
If you make a mistake, Git provides several ways to undo changes.
> `reset --hard` will permanently delete uncommitted changes. Use only when you are absolutely sure.
> `revert` is preferred in shared projects because it doesn’t change history – it just adds a “reverse” commit.

```bash
# Unstage files (but keep changes)
git reset

# Undo last commit, keep changes unstaged
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and discard changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Undo a commit by creating a new one that reverses it
git revert <commit-hash>
```



## Real-world Examples

### Typical Workflow   
```bash
# Every morning:
git checkout main
git pull origin main      # Always sync first

# Create a new task branch
git checkout -b feature/user-profile

# --- Code, code, code... ---

# Save your progress
git add .
git commit -m "Build user profile page"
git push origin feature/user-profile

# When done, create a Pull Request on GitHub
```
