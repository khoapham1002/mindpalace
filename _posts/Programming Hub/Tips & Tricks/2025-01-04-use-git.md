## Git Basics

> You need to know some basic terminal commands to navigate the file system and interact with Git repositories.  
> Go to [Use Terminal](http://127.0.0.1:4000/mindpalace/posts/use-terminal/).

### Initialize and check status

```bash
git init
```

```bash
git status
git branch
git remote -v
```

### Link to a remote repository

```bash
# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin <repository-URL>

# View the linked remote repository
git remote -v

# Push the default branch and set upstream tracking
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Update remote repository

```bash
# View the current remote URL
git remote -v

# Update the remote URL
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/new-repo-name.git

# Sync changes with the new repository
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### Stage, commit and push (sync) changes

```bash
# Stage all files for commit
git add .

# Commit staged changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push changes to the main branch
git push origin main
```

### Tags

```bash
# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0 with stable features"

# Push the tag to GitHub
git push origin v1.0

# Check out a specific tag (detached HEAD state)
git checkout v1.0
```

```bash
# Delete a tag locally
git tag -d v1.0

# Delete a tag from GitHub
git push origin --delete v1.0

# Recreate and push an updated tag
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Updated version v1.0"
git push origin v1.0
```

### Branches

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stage, commit, and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature
```

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the feature branch into main
git merge feature/new-feature

# Push changes to main
git push origin main

# Delete the local branch
git branch -d feature/new-feature
```

```bash
# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch_name

# Prune stale remote branches
git fetch --prune

# View remote branches
git branch -r
```

## Real-world Examples

### Team Project Workflow

```bash
# Clone a shared repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/organization/project-repo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd project-repo

# Set your Git identity (if not already configured globally)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch for your task
git checkout -b feature/task-name

# Check the branch to confirm
git branch
```

```bash
# Add or modify files, then stage them for commit
git add path/to/changed/file

# Commit your changes with a message
git commit -m "Implement feature X for task Y"
```

```bash
# Pull the latest changes from the main branch to avoid conflicts
git pull origin main

# Push your feature branch to the remote repository
git push origin feature/task-name
```


### Resolving Conflicts

```bash
# After detecting conflicts, view the affected files
git status

# Open the conflicting file in an editor and resolve the conflicts
# Then mark the file as resolved
git add resolved-file

# Commit the resolved conflicts
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict in file"

# Create a new commit that undoes a specific commit
git revert <commit-hash>
```

### Debugging
```bash
# View a detailed commit history
git log --oneline --graph --all

# View who changed specific lines in a file
git blame path/to/file

# Reset to a specific commit (hard reset erases changes)
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
```
