## General Probability Concepts

### 1) Sets, Venn Diagrams, Events, and Sample Spaces
- Mutually exclusive (disjoint) vs Non-mutually exclusive (no overlap)
- Union, intersection, and complement of events
- Addition and multiplication rules for probabilities
- Independent and mutually exclusive events
    - Independent events do not affect each other's probabilities
        - P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
    - Mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously
        - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
- Conditional probability
    - P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
